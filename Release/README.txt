
from the developers:

about colors:
in first version of Way Editor was made such dark theme
by my friend from WarerCode - Evgeniy. It was beauty, but
in second version I want to make radioButton-triggers for
errors and warnings. And I can't reset button's text color yet.
I have decided make BLACK_WINDOW_THEME more light.
You can try old version:
#define BLACK_WINDOW_THEME {9, 27, 56}
(defines at General.h header)
